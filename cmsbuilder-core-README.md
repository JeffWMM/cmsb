## **üìå Notes & Best Practices**
- Avoid modifying **core library files** (`lib/`) directly. Instead, use **plugins** to extend functionality.
- Keep **database-related functions** inside `database_functions.php`.
- For security, **never expose `admin.php` publicly**‚Äîrestrict access via `.htaccess`.

## üöÄ **How to Extend cmsBuilder**
1. **Use Plugins**: Create a new file in `plugins/` to add custom functionality.
2. **Use Hooks**: Hook into cmsBuilder‚Äôs API instead of modifying core files.
3. **Use `admin_functions.php`** for admin-related custom functions.
4. **Use `viewer_functions.php`** for customizing frontend displays.
